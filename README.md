# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
A used car dealership aims to analyze the mileage-sale price relationship across car brands to assess predictability and variations in slopes/intercepts. Leveraging these insights, they seek to optimize pricing, enhance customer satisfaction, and establish market leadership.
The dataset used for analysis consists of information on the mileage and sale prices of used cars. The key variables in the dataset are:
1.	Mileage: This variable represents the recorded mileage of each car in miles. It indicates the distance the car has traveled and can serve as a proxy for its overall usage and condition.
2.	Sale Price: This variable represents the price at which each car was sold. It reflects the market value of the car and is influenced by various factors, including mileage.
To initiate the analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify patterns and relationships between mileage and sale prices for each car brand. Additionally, other interesting variables and their relationships will be explored to gain insights into factors that may impact the price customers are willing to pay.

During EDA, summary statistics and visualizations will be utilized to examine the distribution of the response variable (sale price) and its relationship with the mileage. Box plots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis will be employed to understand the associations between mileage and sale prices across different car brands. Furthermore, other relevant variables, such as the age of the car, fuel efficiency, or horsepower, may be explored to identify potential additional factors that might play a role in determining the price a customer is willing to pay.

The analysis will focus on uncovering meaningful insights to inform the dealership's pricing strategy and help them achieve their objectives of increasing profitability, customer satisfaction, and market traction.
